<h1> The Science of Sleep and Dreams </h1>
<h2> The Importance of Sleep Stages </h2>
<p>
    Sleep is a dynamic process divided into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) stages,
    each essential for rejuvenation. NREM sleep aids in physical repair and memory organization, while REM sleep
    is the stage where dreams predominantly occur. During REM sleep, the brain processes emotions, solves problems,
    and enhances creativity, making sleep critical for both mental and physical health.
</p>
<h2> The Mystery of Dreams </h2>
<p>
    Dreams are one of the most intriguing aspects of sleep. Modern research suggests that dreams help
    consolidate memories and process emotions, acting as a mental rehearsal space. During REM sleep, the brain
    creates vivid and often bizarre narratives, fostering creativity and allowing the subconscious to explore
    connections that may go unnoticed while awake.
</p>
<h2> The Consequences of Sleep Deprivation </h2>
<p>
    Sleep deprivation highlights the importance of a full night's rest. Even one poor night of sleep can impair
    focus, memory, and decision-making, while chronic deprivation increases risks for conditions like heart disease
    and neurodegeneration. Sleep also acts as the brain's detox system, clearing harmful toxins, including those
    linked to Alzheimer's. Research continues to emphasize that sleep is not merely a passive state but a
    cornerstone of overall health and well-being.
